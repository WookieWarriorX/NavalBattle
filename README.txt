Requirements for developers:

This game is a bit harder than casual Naval Battle games:
1. Train your memory!
When you destroy a ship, you get no notification, so you need to plan
your shots carefully and memorize destroyed ships sizes.
Same rule for the AI. Try not to waste you shots.

2. Train your imagination!
There is no display of ship spacing, so you can train your visualisation
skill like in board chess.


This game is a bit different from casual Naval Battle games:
1. AI is pretty strong, but not cheating at all.
Difficulty of the game configured to 60% human win ratio according
to public testing. If you lose, you always have a chance to take revanche.

2. Don't waste your time!
Both game boards (yours and your opponent's) are randomly generated
each time the game is started.


How to play:
0. Launch NavalBattle.py file in Python 3.10 interpreter.
1. Right from the start you can press tiles on enemy board by your mouse
pointer. Try yourself and make your first move.

2. After that you can see current AI move highlighted on your board.

3. Carry on, find your way to victory, admiral!

4. When the battle is over, you will see a notification from your staff
at the upper right corner.


Good luck, admiral!
